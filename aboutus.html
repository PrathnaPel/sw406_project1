				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<q>Promote oportunities for Bridgeport community by providing a platform for students to learn, connect, and explore into the field of engineering.
					To spread STEM awareness to the Greater Bridgeport Area. Our goal is to strive as a team, encourage professionalism, and build relationships with our community.</q>
				<h2> What is FRC?</h2>
				<q>FIRST Robotics Competition is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build game-playing robots that weigh up to 120 pounds.</q>

				EG 0260 Robots 3 Credits
				Prerequisite: PS 0115.
				</ul>
				
				Introductory course in robotics develops understanding of how robotic systems integrate sensors, actuators, and control systems to achieve specific goals.
				Principles of autonomy, programming, wireless communications, sensor applications, mechatronics, electrical power, electric motors, pneumatics, structure, and locomotion will be understood and applied.
				Design of robotic subsystems will utilize multiple areas of knowledge. 
				The course will involve application of statistical analysis to quantify robot performance. 
				Service learning is an integral part of the course. 
				All participants will participate in weekly mentoring of a youth robotics competition team to put into practice the principles learned in class, and to learn through community interaction from other students using robots to accomplish different feats.
				
				SW 0304 Web Development 3 Credits
				Attributes: ENPC Digital Journalism Production Component
				Prerequisite: CS 0131.
				This course introduces the student to developing applications for use on the World Wide Web. Students learn basic n-tier concepts for designing distributed applications and gain hands on experience through the construction of Web-based applications. The course covers concepts that allow communication over the Web. This includes designing and authoring Web pages, markup languages, the client-side document object model, usability, search engine optimization, and client-side dynamic Web pages
