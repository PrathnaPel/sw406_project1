				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<section>
							<q style="font-size: 140%; font-style: italic;">Promote opportunities for Bridgeport community by providing a platform for students to learn, connect, and explore the field of engineering. 
					To spread STEM awareness to the Greater Bridgeport Area. 
					Our goal is to strive as a team, encourage professionalism, and build relationships with our community.</q>	
				</section>
				<h2> What is FRC?</h2>
				<q>FIRST Robotics Competition is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build game-playing robots that weigh up to 120 pounds.</q>
